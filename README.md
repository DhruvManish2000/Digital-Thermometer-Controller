# Digital-Thermometer-Controller

This project will develop an embedded system that could form the basis for a home (forced-air furnace) thermostat. Like a normal thermostat, the user will be able to set the temperature. Unlike a normal thermostat, though, the system will allow the user to configure which of two temperature sensors will be used to control the system. 

The design acheives the following:

- Detects Temperature with internal sensor in ATmega328P
- Detects Temperature with external LM35 sensor
- Displays the temperatures on an LCD screen
- Has a user defined temperature control and fedback on whether heating is required
